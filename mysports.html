                        <h4>MySports</h4>
                        <p>MySports allows users to easily view information and scores from their favorite sports. Four sports leagues are featured in the application (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL). Users can easily access and personalize their favorite teams and favorite players. If a user wants to look up a team that is not on their favorites list, a list of all teams is also available. Users can view a schedule of games, which shows game times, as well as scores and statistics. If a game is live, realtime scores will be updated. The application shows news, which users can filter depending on their interests. Users have the option to receive notifications about certain types of news, as well as upcoming games.

                        <h4>About</h4>
                        <h4>Proposal</h4>
                    
                        <h4>Why</h4>
                        <p>There are many applications on the market right now that display sports scores and statistics. Most of the current applications have many problems, and MySports tries to address those problems.
                        </p>
                        </br>

                    <h4>Current Application Limitations</h4>
                    <p>The current NFL Mobile application has many problems. Advertisements constantly get in the way. If you accidentally click on a video, you have to watch an ad that lasts 30 seconds with no options to close or stop it. The interface is very cluttered and inconsistent, as if different sections were designed by different people. It is difficult to customize with your favorite teams. And it is hard to find scores for a specific team. The average rating for the NFL mobile application on the App Store is 2 stars. Similarly to NFL Mobile, NBA Game Time has many problems. NBA Game Time has a very inconsistent user interface. Important features are hard to find, and it is difficult to customize features. Some of the icons used in the application are not relevant to their intended purpose.
                    </p>

                <h4>Personas</h4>
                <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
                <h4>IRB Test Plan</h4>
                <h4>Design Guidelines</h4>
                <h4>Final Hi-Fidelity Design</h4>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>MySports tries to fix the problems that were found in current applications. It uses a consistent color scheme throughout the entire application. Advertisements are designed to coexist within other features of the application, and to be non obtrusive. There are no video or advertisement popups that the user isn't expecting. MySports is easy to navigate, and easy to add/remove favorites. Users can quickly find what they are looking for with little or no difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>Our application changes the way viewers will be able to manage their favorite sports on a mobile device. It focuses on the design of the displayed information and navigation. Working on this project, we learned that revision is very important in designing a user friendly application. The more feedback obtained from users, the better the final application will turn out. Without user feedback, this application would not be as simple or as user friendly as it turned out. Thanks to users, the design was able to evolve into a more simplistic version of our original idea, that gets all user goals done in an easy way.
