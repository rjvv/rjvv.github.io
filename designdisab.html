                                                <h4>Design Meets Disability by Graham Pullin (2009)</h4>

                        <p>Literature Review by Ryan Van Vechten - Fall 2013</p>

						
					<p>   Design Meets Disability by Graham Pullin is a book about how good design can and

should exist within the world of disability. In order for disabled people to easily navigate the

world, they need assistive technologies that allow them to do so. Most of assistive technology

devices are made without considering the aesthetics. If something doesn't look good, people

aren't going to feel comfortable using it or not want to use it at all. Good design can make

someone want to use a product they normally would not want to use. The assistive technologies

the book mainly focuses on are glasses, hearing aids and wheelchairs.</p>


                    
<p>The topic of design for disability is interesting because it is relatively new. Most of the

assistive technology that we see in use today was created just in the last century, and is usually

made without thinking about design. There are very few products available today for assistive

technology that are well designed.</p>

<p>We are at the point where we have an extremely large range of products for the disabled, but

most of them aren't appealing. They are simply just products, they have no connection to design

and they have a hard time trying to be discrete. There is lots of room to come up with new

designs, which is why design for disability is interesting. Design for assistive technology should

be just as important as the functional role of devices. Design for disability is an area that should

be focused on by more designers. Although it doesn't have as many users as the general public,

there is a certain type of gratification that comes with designing for assistive technology.

Vision loss is one of the most prevalent disabilities in the world. Without design, glasses

would not be seen as something that is fashionable. People would not want to wear glasses if

they were all the same. Different people have different styles and preferences which is why

design is necessary for disability. In order to advance the field of assistive technologies, we need

to make sure there is a design suitable for everyone and meets their needs.</p>

<p>Discretion allows a disabled person to complete everyday tasks without people asking if

they need help, or attracting unwanted attention. An assistive device that is not seen by others

would be considered discrete, only you would know that you have it. Discretion is highly desired

in assistive devices, because it covers up and attempts to camouflage the device. Discretion may

just be popular within the disabled community because it is a quick, cheap, and easy way to get a

product to the market without having to worry about a strange design. A discrete product can

have greater appeal because unlike normal products, it detracts attention, it is essentially

invisible. But when discrete products are noticed, they are not appealing whatsoever. For

example, flesh colored hearing aids are very discrete. They hide in plain sight, but once they are

noticed they are not desirable to look at. Although discretion is easy to achieve, designers should

spend the time to make things that are fashionable, and can proudly represent the person using

them. We should focus on good design that is present to the surrounding world rather than being

discrete.</p>

<p>In order to design a wide range of devices that fit many peoples needs, we need to turn to

fashion designers. Fashion designers are anything but discreet, they like to push the boundaries

of design. Fashion designers like to design things that they know will not work or be practical.

By experimenting, we come up with new ideas and ways for people to interpret different ideas.

The more we experiment with design and fashion for accessibility, the more well designed

devices we will have. If there are more products then there are more choices that will suit the

different styles of disabled people. This will cause people to be more likely to choose a design

that is not discreet, but rather very stylish and expressing their personality.</p>

<p>Of course when you introduce radical topics such as fashion into design for disability

there are going to be problems. If someone who has worn a discreet assistive device their entire

life is suddenly given a device designed by a fashion designer, it could seem very unnatural.

People may not want to switch to a fashion design after being so used to their discreet device.

But, this is how design within the fashion world works. In order for their to be progress there

needs to be radical designs that are not liked by everyone. With radical designs come new

interpretations that will eventually become accepted by wider audiences. In order to transition

from discretion into fashion design, we need to accept change and build a culture around new

and different designs.</p>

<p>One area of assistive devices that already has its very own fashion culture is glasses.

People did not want to wear glasses when they where first introduced. Now glasses are a sign of

power and being intelligent. When glasses started becoming used by more and more people, the

designs started evolving. A lot of experimenting goes on in the design of glasses. Glasses are

now to a point where people see them as a fashion accessory rather than an assistive device.

Glasses are now considered “eyewear”, in the sense that they are a fashion accessory and not an

assistive device. Eyewear can be worn by anyone, for sun protection, for improved sight, or just

for looks. There are thousands of different eyewear designs, enough to suit everyones individual

needs without having to be discreet and wear contact lenses. In order for design for disability to

become more popular, there needs to be a greater balance between function and fashion. The

most popular eyewear designs are the ones that are “between invisibility and extreme visibility”.

It takes a lot of skill to create a very popular product, every detail must be polished and there

can’t be anything that could make the product attract too much attention. Good eyewear design

needs to make the wearer look good, while attracting very minimal attention to the glasses

themselves.</p>

<p>Hearing aids are in a very weird place right now. There are currently very few options for

visible hearing aids that look good. Many hearing aids that are visible right now are pink to

simulate skin, but that just makes them look cheap and tacky. Hearing aid design is expected to

go in a similar direction as eyewear, except being called hearwear. In order for hearwear to

succeed, there needs to be radical new designs from many different perspectives. Bluetooth

headsets are becoming more popular among the general public, and could provide a good basis

for the design of future hearing aids. Headphones or earbuds are extremely popular among the

vast majority of people. Apple’s signature white earbuds have become a fashion icon in

themselves. People sometimes wear Apple earbuds without plugging in to anything, so this could

be a great platform to incorporate hearing aids into. The person would obviously be wearing

headphones, but no one would question why or think of them as disabled. The main goal for

hearwear is to create a product that complements the wearer, and achieves this through good

design.</p>

<p>In order for compelling products to come into existence, we need collaboration. Someone

that may be experienced in engineering could have a very good idea. A prototype for their idea

could easily be built by themselves, and be able to function exactly how they want it to. The

problem is that design of this prototype was never considered, and probably will not be for the

final version of the product. Collaboration happening between engineers and designers needs to

happen in order to make great products. If there is a better balance of people with experience in

different fields, the more possibilities of compelling products will be made a reality. It is all a

matter of people coming together that normally would not. Collaboration is something that is

often overlooked, but it should not be.</p>

<p>Wheelchairs have always had a very recognizable design, a design that is not always

pleasant to look at but still functions as intended. Wheelchair design is almost at a standstill.

Sure, there are newer wheelchairs being built with more advanced materials, but the overall

design of the wheelchair doesn't change. In contrast, chairs that you would find in almost

everyones homes have extremely varying designs that do not always follow the same principles.

Chairs are always evolving and have hundreds of thousands of variations. They can be very basic

or very complex. Wheelchair design needs to be more like how chairs are designed. There should

be no standard wheelchair design, but there should be different chairs for different styles/tastes/

preferences/environments. Moving toward a more open idea for wheelchair design takes time,

but it is already happening. There are already chairs for sports, off road environments, and low

income people. Expanding the number of wheelchair designs takes time. The ultimate goal

would to make it possible for people to have multiple wheelchairs each for different uses.

A universal design can complete a large list of tasks and has many different functions.

Although it may sound good that it can complete a large number of tasks, it is often very

complicated and has many components that allow it to be universal. There can be lots of

instructions, further complicating a universal design.</p>

<p>A simple design is refined to work for a specific task very well. It has limited controls,

but is extremely easy to use for its given use. There is a very low learning curve for simple

design, and there is almost never a need for instructions.</p>

<p>There is a lot of tension between designs that are both simple and universal. It is very

hard to build a good product that is both universal and simple. It is easier to design one or the

other, but not both. When a simple design is required to be universal, there is suddenly lots of

new features that need to be added in order to satisfy a larger group of people. The more features

that are added, the less simple the design becomes. There is a sort of tug-of-war between the two.

In order for designs to become very easily universal and simple there needs to be more

innovation in terms of technology. There are currently very few products that are both universal

and simple. One of the ways to easily achieve universality, is to take custom orders. Custom

orders allow for the user to specify their requirements and receive a custom product that is built

for them, so it is simple. But this method does not make the product universal to the whole

world, it just builds it to fit the requirements of a certain person. Once this product is built, it can

only be used by someone else with the same requirements as the person that ordered it. This is a

step in the right direction, but there are still limitations that do not make it completely universal.

The best example of a universal product that is simple is the Apple iPad. The iPad can be used by

almost anyone because of its simple design and interface. The same iPad can be customized

multiple times, which allows for the iPad to be easily sold from person to person. It doesn't really

get much better than the iPad. The iPad was made from extensive research and development, it

didn't just appear overnight built from hardware store components.</p>

<p>In order to make design for disability more universal and simple, research and

development needs to happen. The problem with universal design in disability, is that almost

everyone has different needs. This complicates the idea of universality because everyone needs

something different. Not everyone can have the same thing. If the iPad can be universal and

simple, its only a matter of time before design for disability adopts the same principles. A truly

universal product may not happen, but customized products for the disabled could be just as

good.</p>

<p>Once designers start focusing in on certain areas and collaborating with engineers, they

create new approaches that change they way we think about design. For example, carbon fiber

and the ability to 3d print materials are changing the world of design. 3d printing allows for rapid

prototyping which allows for designers to create their ideas extremely fast and quickly move

onto new designs when their previous designs fail. 3d printing allows for parts to be created that

would not be able to be made any other way. This can apply to almost every aspect of design for

disability, creating many custom products for different types of people. Glasses could be 3d

printed specifically for a persons style, hearing aids could be 3d printed to fit the shape of the ear.

Innovations in design for disability could help solve problems in the world for people that are not

disabled also. There are many possibilities, and 3d printing is definitely a game changer in terms

of design for disability.</p>

<p>There is a lot of controversy in design for disability. One of the big roadblocks for many

designers, is that they don't want to experiment with new radical designs. People should not be

shocked when they see a disabled person, but unfortunately that happens very often. Disabled

people need to be treated like the general population. This is starting to happen, but very slowly.

Assistive devices should not be invisible, and should never mimic human flesh. We need to

move away from the idea of hiding disabilities and introducing them as works of design. The

more people that embrace design for disability, the more normal it will seem.</p>

<p>Design for disability should always be considered when creating assistive devices and

technologies. In order for good design to happen, engineers need to realize that designers are

going to make their ideas much better and vice versa.</p>

<p>Design for disability needs to become more mainstream, which will benefit both disabled and

non-disabled people. In order to progress, we need to experiment and collaborate. We need to

spend the time thinking about what makes a product better and why it would help to be different

the what is already available. Every device can be improved upon, it is just how we do it.</p>

I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a new view on design that I would have never

payed attention to. It has made me want to focus more on design for disability in terms of a job. I

want to work in Human Computer Interaction, and I will always think back to this book when

designing something.</p>
